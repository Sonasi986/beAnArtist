# beAnArtist

A great student project in java where the goal was to create a drawing software.

## Description

This project was a school project lasting 4 months at a rate of 4 hours per week.
This project was entirely done in Java without any libraries. The power of this project is based on the good exploitation of object-oriented programming.
